	\section{The Tech Renaissance}
	\subsection{The Internet boom of the 90s}
	\paragraph{The rise of the bullshit around us is just absurd fr fr }
	\subsection{The Smartphone revolution}
	\paragraph{What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo}
	\section{The Changing Cultural Values}
	\subsection{The Changing views of the GEN-Z}
	\paragraph{I read a lot of articles that show all of the similarities between Trump and Adolf Hitler. It has me so scared. I have many friends who are Hispanic, Muslim, and LGBTP and I am literally shaking knowing that on January 21st there is a good chance that they will all be rounded up in concentration camps and sent to the gas chambers. He was endorsed by the KKK and alt-right extremism is on the rise. I am most concerned about how this affects the younger generations. During thanksgiving dinner I had to yell at my young niece who mentioned that Pepe was her favorite "meme." I firmly explained to her that Pepe was a symbol of racism and made her delete all of the Pepes from her phone. Her parents actually defended her when she started crying, which was a horrifying revelation about how you can never tell who is a deeply closeted racist/Trump supporter until it is too late. Our youth are being radicalized. I have contacted CPS for my niece, and am thinking of moving to Sweden to be somewhere more tolerant. At least when the nuclear bombs fall, I will die standing up for what is right.}
	\subsection{The Acceptance movement and the SJW wars of the 2010s}
	\paragraph{Like pouring a cup of dirty water into a sea of syphilitic piss.}
	\subsection{The rise of 4Chan - The Right Anti Establishment}
	\paragraph{OK, you know what? Fuck you. Fuck all of you immature, insensitive, ignorant assholes. The failed copypasta trolling on here is ridiculous and needs to stop. I imagine all of you immature /b/ kids, sitting in front of your computers giggling like little school girls as you hit ctrl-c-ctrl-v after ctrl-c-ctrl-v and expend little to no effort in your trolling. I bet that most of you aren't even trolls in real life and are only saying this stuff on here to be funny, shocking, and because you can't come up with anything original. And that just sucks. This is not a joke. IT IS WRONG. Don't sit and there and pretend like you don't care, that you don't have any morals, because you do. We all do. And you should feel ashamed of yourselves, but you don't because you are too immature to realize the damage you cause with your "humorous" old copypasta pictures and words. None of you, NONE of you, can possibly know what it is like to post OC. You couldn't possibly understand just how hurtful and humiliating it is for someone to put thought and effort into a post, the way they feel when they are treated with discrimination and prejudice. So why would you laugh and turn this into a joke? OC posters have had to deal with this bullshit for years and they have come so incredibly far. So now when some immature, pasty, fat dick head sitting in front of their computer just blatantly spews failed memes and stale pasta as a means of humor, it is incredibly damaging. You are all children, who don't understand what you are doing and just how important it is that we refrain from using these words and ideas. You think "Oh it's alright there's no OC posters here and I'm just doing it for shock value". No, it still leads to hate and discrimination in more ways than you could even begin to understand. It's time to grow up and start understanding the magnitude and consequences of your actions. You are all pathetic children. Grow up, damn you.}
