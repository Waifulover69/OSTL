	\begin{equation}
	\label{emc}
		a_1^2 + b_1^2 = c_1^2
		\newline
	\end{equation}
	The given equation \ref{emc} is known as the pythagoras theorum
	\begin{equation}
		\label{emc2}
			\sum_{i=0}^{n}\sqrt[3]{\frac{a_i + b_i}{c_i}}
	\end{equation}
	This equation \ref{emc2} is a very complex equation and LaTeX is giving me errors for no reason tho the output is right (life amirite)

	\section{}
	Given a quadratic equation,$$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$$, then if $$\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} \geq 0$$, roots of the equation are real. Else, the roots are complex.

	"The De Morgan laws in Set Theory are given in Eq. XXX as follows.
	$$\bar{A \cup B} = \bar{A} \cap \bar{B}$$
	$$\bar{A \cap B} = \bar{A} \cup \bar{B}$$
	
	Where A and B are Sets, $\bar{A}$ and $\bar{B}$ are the complements of sets A and B, $\cup$ is the Union and $\cap$ is the Intersection operations."
